# Product Description & Purpose

Easily pull Vimeo videos into the Yext Platform. Vimeo is a video hosting platform that many brands use to store and share their company videos. This data connector pulls all Vimeo videos into a user’s Knowledge Graph, allowing them to add multimedia to Answers experiences with built-in video cards, embed videos onto Yext Pages, and much more!

The Vimeo Connector automatically syncs your video data to Yext on a daily basis. Any time you add, update, or remove a video in Vimeo, these same changes will occur in Yext. Now you can extend the reach of your Vimeo data even further to power Yext Pages and Search experiences! 

This app creates a custom Vimeo Video entity type and creates the following custom fields: 

- vimeo\_vimeo
- vimeo\_categories
- vimeo\_comments
- vimeo\_contentRating
- vimeo\_creator
- vimeo\_description
- vimeo\_duration

- vimeo\_likes
- vimeo\_releaseDate
- vimeo\_tags
