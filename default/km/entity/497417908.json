    "c_description": "They say hindsight is 2020, but after the year we’ve just had no one really wants to look back. People are eager to move forward and return to normal, but the reality is that version of normal has left the building for good. Our world has never been more remote -- and more digital.\n\nIn fact, if 2020 taught us anything it’s that things can turn “digital only” on a dime. \nSo if a company -- not to mention an entire industry -- is just thinking about a modern, comprehensive digital transformation in 2021 for their prospects, customers, and employees, they’re way too late. COVID will be behind us someday soon, but being “digital best” is the only way forward.\n\nJoin Howard Lerman, Founder and CEO of Yext, and Scott Galloway, NYU Business School professor, New York Times bestselling author of Post Corona, and Pivot and The Prof G Show podcast host, to hear their thoughts on how different industries have not only adapted to, but thrived in the digital transformation brought on by the global pandemic. In the first Yext Talk of the new year, they’ll discuss the future of work and how companies need to use digital technologies, like search, to deliver best-in-class experiences to customers and employees alike -- and share their bold perspectives on which industries are ripe for a digital best disruption in 2021.",
