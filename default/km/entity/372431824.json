New features in search results — knowledge cards, featured snippets, local packs, ads, FAQs, and more — meet consumer intent directly on the search results page. That means click-through rates and webpage traffic can drop, even for brands and content that capture the coveted “position zero.” This session examines what this means for marketers: how to rank in an increasingly complex ecosystem, new metrics that matter, opportunities for engagement directly in a search experience, and tactics that will drive clicks. Listen as this panel of expert search marketers explore these changes and suggest pathways to success.",
