    "c_description": "\"Search\" and \"Query\" are not synonyms. In fact, the journey from \"Search\" to \"Query\" is a continuum of discovery where the questions of consumers are a process of refinement and a journey built on trust. Consumers struggle with too much information to process. They need a way to quickly explore what they are looking for and then, equally as easily, exploit that information to take action. Brands need to rethink their persona-based marketing in a world where every question asked is their most valuable asset in designing a multi-dimensional customer experience. Learn how to build real customer trust by re-thinking your global search strategy and explore how NLP and AI approaches can answer your customer questions from \"search\" to \"query\".",
